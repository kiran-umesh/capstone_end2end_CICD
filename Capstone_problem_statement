**Problem Statement:**

Design and develop a comprehensive internship management platform called **Internsheep**. This platform should consist of three main servicesâ€”Auth Service, User Service, and Company Service. Each service needs to manage distinct functionalities related to user authentication, user profile details, and company details, respectively.

### Requirements:
1. **Auth Service:**
   - Register new users and authenticate existing users.
   - Generate and validate JWT tokens to secure protected routes.
   - Handle error cases like user already existing, invalid credentials, or missing authorization headers.

2. **User Service:**
   - Create, update, and retrieve user profiles, including optional profile picture uploads.
   - Manage user education and work experience entries.
   - Provide endpoints for uploading and retrieving user resumes.

3. **Company Service:**
   - Create, update, and retrieve company profiles for users with a company role.
   - Allow company logo uploads and deletion of company profiles.
   
### Key Functionalities to Implement:
- Secure endpoints using JWT tokens.
- Implement CRUD operations for user and company profiles.
- Provide error handling for common issues like invalid tokens, missing data, or user not found.
- Ensure that the API endpoints are well-documented and accessible for integration with frontend applications.

### Technical Requirements:
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Define ports, MongoDB connection strings, JWT secrets, Redis host and port, Kafka broker connection string, AWS region, AWS access keys, and S3 bucket name.
  
- **Setup Instructions:**
  - Use Docker Compose to run the services.

### Objectives:
- Provide a seamless and secure experience for users to manage their authentication, profiles, and company details.
- Ensure scalability and maintainability by using microservices architecture.
- Enhance developer productivity with clear API documentation.

This project aims to streamline the management of internships, offering a robust and user-friendly platform for students and companies alike.
